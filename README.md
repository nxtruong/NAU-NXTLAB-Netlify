## Homepage

Several options for the top part of the homepage:
- Use the `blank` widget and write custom content (file `welcome1.md`): a very flexible way to write any content.  This is a "traditional" homepage.
- Use the `about` widget of the author `lab` (file `welcome2.md`): the about content will be in the `_index.md` file of the lab author.  An issue is the avatar, which is either unavailable or not looking good.
- Use the `slider` widget (no implementation yet): use several short slides or images to show different aspects and link to important pages (like "research", "join").  See <https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/blob/main/starters/research-group/content/tour/slider.md?plain=1>.
