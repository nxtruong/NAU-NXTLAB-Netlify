Prof. Nghiem received the **prestigious Engineering Research Initiation (ERI) award/grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF)**.  The $200K grant, which starts in March 2023 and lasts 2 years, will support Prof. Nghiem's and the lab's research on developing novel data-driven methods based on machine learning for modeling and predictive control of building energy systems.  We are very thankful for the support from the NSF.
