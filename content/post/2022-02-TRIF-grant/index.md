We are thrilled to receive a **grant of $5K from the Arizona Technology and Research Initiative Fund (TRIF)** to study occupancy-based HVAC controls for energy savings in academic buildings.  The grant will provide summer support for a student to conduct the research.  We are very thankful for the support from the AZ TRIF and NAU.
