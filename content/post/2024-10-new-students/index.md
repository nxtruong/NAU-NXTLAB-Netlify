Two new undergraduate students joined our lab in October 2024.
Donovan Ho and Andrew Mitchell are both senior students in computer science at UCF, who joined the iCPS Lab to learn and explore research in robotics and autonomous vehicles, using our F1tenth autonomous race cars.
Welcome Donovan and Andrew to the lab.  We hope you will all have a great time and success in our lab and in your studies.
