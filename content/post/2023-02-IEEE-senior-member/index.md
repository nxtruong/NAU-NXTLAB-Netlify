In February 2023, Prof. Nghiem was elected to be a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) - the largest professional organization in our field - for his professional achievements.  Senior member is the highest grade for which IEEE members can apply.  Only about 10% of the IEEE members have achieved this level.  Congratulations to Prof. Nghiem for this important accomplishment.
