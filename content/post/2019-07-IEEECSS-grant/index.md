Prof. Nghiem received a grant from the IEEE Control System Society (IEEE CSS) Outreach fund to develop and organize a university course and an annual robotics summer camp for high-school students, based on the [F1/10 autonomous racing](http://f1tenth.org/) platform.  The project is called FF1RR, which stands for *Flagstaff's F1/10 Robo Racing*.  The funding amount is $15K in addition to a sum of $7K generously provided by NAU SICCS.  We are very grateful to the support from IEEE CSS and NAU SICCS.
