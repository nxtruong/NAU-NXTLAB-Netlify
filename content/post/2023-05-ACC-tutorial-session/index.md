Together with collaborators from PNNL, EPFL, and TAMU, Prof. Nghiem successfully organized a well-received tutorial session at the American Control Conference (ACC) 2023 on physics-informed machine learning (PIML) for modeling and control of dynamical systems.  We presented a tutorial / review of PIML with application in control, and discussed its challenges and opportunities.  Congratulations to Prof. Nghiem and the co-organizers.
