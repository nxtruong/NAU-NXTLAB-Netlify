A paper titled "Connectivity-preserving distributed informative path planning for mobile robot networks" has been published in the prestigious journal IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.  This is a collaboration with TAMU-CC (Drs. Binh Nguyen and Thang Nguyen) and Federation University Australia (Dr. Linh Nguyen).  We proposed a method for distributed informative path planning of a team of mobile robots to efficiently explore, sense, and learn a data-driven model of an unknown environment while preserving their communication links.  Congratulations to the team.

Another paper, titled "Optimal querying for communication-efficient ADMM using Gaussian process regression," has been published in the journal Franklin Open.  The paper proposes and studies methods for optimally querying agents in a communication-efficient distributed optimization system such as ADMM.  The methods utilize Gaussian process regression to learn the proximal operators of the agents to reduce the communication overhead.  This is a result of our continuing collaboration with the group of Dr. Shuangqing Wei at Louisiana State University.
