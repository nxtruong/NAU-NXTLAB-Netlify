We received a $2.5K grant <!-- $2,419.20 --> 
from the NAU's Green Fund for developing machine learning models for prediction and analysis of the demand of different utilities in NAU campus buildings.  Student Trong-Doan Nguyen will work on this project over the summer.  We are very thankful for the support from the Green Fund.
