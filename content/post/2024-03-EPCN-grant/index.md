Prof. Nghiem received a new research grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to develop a novel framework for integrating machine learning into distributed optimization systems to significantly enhance the communication and edge computation efficiency.  The grant is part of the Energy, Power, Control, and Networks (EPCN) Program.  This grant is a collaboration with Prof. Shuangqing Wei at Louisiana State University, where Prof. Nghiem is the lead Principal Investigator.  The project is expected to last 3 years, from April 1, 2024 to March 31, 2027.  The total award is USD 500K, with USD 250K for Prof. Nghiem.

We are very thankful for the support from the NSF.  Once again, congratulations to Prof. Nghiem and our lab for winning this research grant.
