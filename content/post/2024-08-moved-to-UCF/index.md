Prof. Nghiem and the iCPS Lab have moved to a new home: the University of Central Florida (UCF).
Prof. Nghiem has left Northern Arizona University to join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCF as an Associate Professor.
Our research and education passions and mandates, however, stay the same.

We are very thankful for our 6 years at and the support we received from NAU.  We look forward to a bright future of our lab at UCF.
