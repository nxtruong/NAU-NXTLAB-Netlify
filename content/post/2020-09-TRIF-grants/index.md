We are thrilled to receive two grants from NAU, one USD 5K TRA grant (as sole PI) for initiating research in indoor health and safety during a pandemic, and one USD 25K S-REAP grant (as Co-PI) for collaborative research on power and robots.  These grants are part of the Arizona Technology and Research Initiative Fund (TRIF).  We are very thankful for the support from the AZ TRIF and NAU.
