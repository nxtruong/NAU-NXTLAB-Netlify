Prof. Nghiem was awarded the **prestigious CAREER award/grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF)** to develop physics-informed machine learning methods and software tools for dynamical systems, such as energy systems and robots.  The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is the NSF's **most prestigious award in support of early-career faculty** who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education and to lead advances in the mission of their department or organization.  This five-year award of $500K will help Prof. Nghiem establish the long-term research and education foundation of our lab in the exciting area of physics-informed machine learning for dynamical systems.

NAU recently published a news article about this award and Prof. Nghiem's research at https://news.nau.edu/nghiem-machine-learning/.

We are very thankful for the support from the NSF.  Once again, huge congratulations to Prof. Nghiem and our lab for winning this prestigious award.
