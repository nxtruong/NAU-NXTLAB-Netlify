Three new graduate students joined our lab in January 2024.
- Nam Tran Nguyen will be a PhD student, focusing on machine learning and control.
- Cody Beck will be a Masters student in Computer Science, focusing on physics-informed machine learning (methods and software).  Cody had been working in our lab and with Prof. Nghiem on robotics for the last two years.
- Juan Tique Rangel will be a Masters student in Electrical Engineering, focusing on robotics.

Welcome Nam, Cody, and Juan to our lab.  Hope you will all have a great time and success in our lab and in your studies / research.
