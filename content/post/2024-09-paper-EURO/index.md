A paper titled ["Communication-efficient ADMM using quantization-aware Gaussian process regression"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejco.2024.100098) has been published in the journal [EURO Journal on Computational Optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/euro-journal-on-computational-optimization).  The paper develops quantization methods and quantization-aware Gaussian process regression for substantially reducing the communication cost of distributed optimization algorithms such as ADMM.  This is a result of our continuing collaboration with the group of Dr. Shuangqing Wei at Louisiana State University and is funded by our NSF EPCN grant.
