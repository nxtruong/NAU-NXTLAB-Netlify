We are thrilled to receive two new one-year industry grants from the Salt River Project (SRP) utility company.  The first project ($67K), where Prof. Nghiem is the PI, will develop models and software for predicting charging load profiles of commercial electric vehicles.  The second project ($70K), where Prof. Nghiem is a Co-PI, will investigate the trends and impacts of public and workplace charging infrastructure on power grids.  We are very thankful for the support from SRP.
