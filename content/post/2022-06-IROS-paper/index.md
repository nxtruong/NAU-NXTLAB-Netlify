Our conference paper titled "Collision-free Minimum-time Trajectory Planning for Multiple Vehicles based on ADMM," which develops a novel algorithm based on ADMM for collision-free trajectory planning for multiple vehicles, was accepted to the 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).  This is a collaboration with teams from Federation University Australia and Texas A&M - Corpus Christi.  Congratulations to all authors.
