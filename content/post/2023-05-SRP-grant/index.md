We are thrilled to receive a new one-year industry grant, where Prof. Nghiem is the PI, from the Salt River Project (SRP) utility company to continue our last year's project with SRP.  The project will study the impact of commercial electric vehicle charging on the power distribution grid (of SRP), using grid simulations in the software Synergi.  We are very thankful for the support from SRP.
