Two papers from our lab were accepted to the American Control Conference 2023.
- The first paper is a tutorial/review paper, which accompanies a tutorial session to be organized by Prof. Nghiem and collaborators at ACC 2023, on physics-informed machine learning for modeling and control of dynamical systems.  The topic has attracted great interest from the control community.  The paper is titled "Physics-informed machine learning for modeling and control of dynamical systems" and is led by Prof. Nghiem.
- The second paper, titled "Distributed formation trajectory planning for multi-vehicle systems", develops a new method for distributed formation trajectory planning for a network of multiple robots, based on the ADMM.  This is a collaboration with Dr. Thang Nguyen (Texas A&M - Corpus Christi) and Dr. Linh Nguyen (Federation University Australia).

Congratulations to Prof. Truong Nghiem and all co-authors.
