We are much thrilled to receive a **grant of $8.4M from the Army Research Laboratory (ARL)** to innovate cybersecurity for cyber-physical systems, as part of a large NAU team led by Prof. Bertrand Cambou.  Our lab will be responsible for implementing, deploying, and evaluating novel cybersecurity technologies in autonomous robots and robot swarms (both terrestrial and aerial).  We are very thankful for the support from the ARL and the U.S. Army.
