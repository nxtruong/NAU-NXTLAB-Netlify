At the ICONS Lab, we develop the **learning and control foundation of intelligent cyber-physical systems**, with applications in autonomous systems.
<!-- we develop theory, algorithms, tools, technologies, and applications of *intelligent and high-performance control systems*. -->
<!-- These systems are at the core of many complex and critical engineering systems. -->
An *intelligent cyber-physical system* (iCPS) integrates deeply machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for decision and real-time control of a CPS to achieve *high performance*, *adaptability*, *autonomy*, and *safety*.
By integrating learning, AI, control, and optimization, we create methods, algorithms, and engineering solutions for autonomous learning and real-time operation of iCPS.
Our research and research approaches are multi-disciplinary, combining theories and techniques from
- *Computer science*: machine learning, AI, scientific computing;
- *Electrical and computer engineering*: control theory, edge computing, internet-of-things (IoT), sensors, embedded systems;
- *Applied mathematics*: optimization theory, dynamical systems;
- and various application domains.

We are particularly interested in the following application areas:
- **AI-enabled smart and sustainable energy systems** such as smart buildings, connected communities, smart grids, smart cities.
- **Smart environment sensing and monitoring systems** such as mobile robotic sensor networks (MRSN), wireless sensor networks, IoT sensing and monitoring in the built environments.
- **Data-driven control and optimization**.

<!-- - **Learning-based intelligent control systems** that combine machine learning (and AI), computing, optimization, and control theory.  Applications are in energy systems (particularly smart buildings and connected communities), multi-agent systems (e.g., mobile sensing networks), and transportation (e.g., advanced driver-assistance systems, self-driving cars, autonomous drones). -->

The ICONS Lab is in the [School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems](https://nau.edu/siccs) at [Northern Arizona University](https://nau.edu/).
