Dr. Truong X. Nghiem is an Assistant Professor and Assistant Chair of Electrical Engineering at the [School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems (SICCS)](https://nau.edu/school-of-informatics-computing-and-cyber-systems) at [Northern Arizona University (NAU)](https://nau.edu).
He is the founder and director of the [Intelligent Control Systems (ICONS) Laboratory](http://nxtlab.org).

Dr. Nghiem received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Systems Engineering from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu).
Before joining NAU, he was a postdoctoral scientist in the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://la.epfl.ch) at EPFL (Switzerland), and a postdoctoral researcher at Penn.
During his time at Penn, he was a member of the [General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception (GRASP) Laboratory](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu), the Real-time and Embedded Systems Lab (mLab), and the [Penn Research In Embedded Computing and Integrated Systems (PRECISE)](https://precise.seas.upenn.edu) center.

Dr. Nghiem is an NSF CAREER award recipient.

<!-- His research lies in the confluence of control, optimization, machine learning, and computation to address fundamental Cyber-Physical System (CPS) challenges across various domains. Of particular interest are data-driven methods for modeling, controlling, optimizing, and verifying CPS. He is also interested in developing hardware and software platforms for CPS. Application domains span from smart energy systems including smart buildings and smart grid, to transportation, industrial automation, and medical devices. -->
